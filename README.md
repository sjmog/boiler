# Boiler

A deployment-ready Rails 7 (Ruby 3.3.4) with React, TailwindCSS, and other goodies.

## Development

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```
REDIS_URL="redis://127.0.0.1:6379/12"
```

> Optionally, check the .env.sample file for other environment variables you may want to set.

You now have two ways to run the application: with Docker (to mimic production) and without (it's faster).

To make deploys as smooth as possible, you should use Docker. But if you know what you're doing, you can use the faster, non-Docker development workflow.

### With Docker

Run `docker-compose up` to start the application.

### Without Docker

Set up the database like this:

```bash
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Start the application with `bin/dev`.

`bin/dev` uses `foreman` to start the application using the `Procfile.bindev`, with the following processes:

- `web`: the Rails server (with debugging enabled).
- `js`: uses `yarn` to build JavaScript files (such as [React components](./app/javascript/components)). Auto-rebuilds on file changes.
- `css`: Uses yarn to build [CSS files](./app/assets/stylesheets). Auto-rebuilds on file changes.
- `redis`: Starts a Redis server for storing background jobs.
- `sidekiq`: Starts a Sidekiq worker for processing background jobs.

> In production, the `web` process and the `redis` and `sidekiq` processes (for background jobs) live on a `web` server and an `accessory` server, respectively.

You can stop the application with `Ctrl+C`, followed by `bin/stop` to shut down the redis server.

## Testing

Testing is designed to be super-fast and parallelised using [`parallel_tests`](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests).

- **End-to-end/system tests** run in a headless browser with `bin/test spec/system`.
- **Unit tests** run with `bin/test spec/<unit-you-want-to-test>_spec.rb`.

Other testing things:

- **Fixtures** are managed using FactoryBot, and you can find them in the `/factories` directory.


## Production

Boiler recommends the following deployment pipeline:

1. Make your changes on a branch in development.
2. Make a Pull Request from `your-branch` to `staging`. This will trigger the PREVIEW WORKFLOW which sets up a preview environment. Tests are run against that preview environment and reported in the Pull Request.
3. Once the Pull Request is approved, merge it into `staging`. This will trigger the STAGING_WORKFLOW which deploys the app to the staging environment.
4. Once you are content with the staging environment, merge `staging` into `main`. This will trigger the PRODUCTION_WORKFLOW which deploys the app to the production environment.

### PREVIEW WORKFLOW

The preview workflow is triggered by a Pull Request from `your-branch` to `staging`. It:

- Provisions a new minimum setup of infrastructure as defined in `infrastructure.yml` (by default that's two servers (one `web` for Rails and Sidekiq, another `accessories` for Redis and Postgres), a load balancer, a firewall, and a Cloudflare subdomain.)
- Rebuilds the Docker images and pushes them to Docker Hub with the tag `your-app:preview-<branch-number>`.
- Deploys the app to this preview environment using Kamal.
- Runs the tests and reports the results in the Pull Request.

You can visit your preview environment at `https://dev-preview-<branch-number>.yourdomain.com`.

### STAGING_WORKFLOW

The staging workflow is triggered by merging your preview Pull Request into `staging`. It:

- Ensures staging environment infrastructure exists as defined in `infrastructure.yml`.
- Rebuilds the Docker images and pushes them to Docker Hub with the tag `your-app:staging-<branch-number>`.
- Deploys the app to this staging environment using Kamal.
- Runs the tests and reports the results in the Pull Request.

You can visit your staging environment at `https://dev-staging.yourdomain.com`.

### PRODUCTION_WORKFLOW

The production workflow is triggered by merging `staging` into `main`. It:

- Ensures production environment infrastructure exists as defined in `infrastructure.yml`.
- Rebuilds the Docker images and pushes them to Docker Hub with the tag `your-app:latest`.
- Deploys the app to this production environment using Kamal.

### Old workflow

Deployment is handled in two parts: Provisioning and Deployment.

### Provisioning sets up the infrastructure

1. Set up a [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) account and get an API key for a project.
2. Set up a [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/free-trial?utm_source=boiler) account and get an API token.
3. Sign up for [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and get a username and password. Add the password to your `.env` file as `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`.
4. Run `bin/provision` to prepare the provisioning of the app. You can speed things up by adding the following environment variables:

```bash
HETZNER_API_KEY=your-hetzner-api-key
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your-cloudflare-api-token
GITHUB_USERNAME=your-github-username
DOMAIN_NAME=your-domain-name-e.g.-techmap.app
SUBDOMAIN=your-subdomain,-e.g.-boiler
```

> You can run `bin/provision` to add or change infrastructure any time. "It just worksâ„¢"

Run `bin/teardown` to tear down the infrastructure. This is permanent!

> See the [terraform README](./terraform/README.md) for more.

### Deployment sends your code to production

To get set up for deployment:

1. Get an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

Run `kamal deploy` to deploy the app.

# Things you might want to do

### Set up Google OAuth2 login

1. Get an account on [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project.
3. Create new OAuth client ID and secret for your project.
  i. For the authorised JavaScript origins, add `https://localhost:3000` and your production URL.
  ii. For the authorised redirect URIs, add `https://localhost:3000/users/auth/google_oauth2/callback` and `https://<your-domain>/users/auth/google_oauth2/callback`.
4. Set the following environment variables:

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

Google login will appear automatically in the combined login/signup page.

> For other OAuth2 providers, set the environment variables as in [the register or sign in view](./app/views/devise/registrations/new_or_sign_in.html.erb).

### Create an admin user

Use `rails c` to create an admin user:

```ruby
User.create!(email: "admin@example.com", password: "password", admin: true)
```

### Schedule a recurring job (cron job)

Boiler uses [sidekiq-cron](https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron) to run cron jobs. cron jobs are defined in `config/schedule.yml`. sidekiq-cron is smart enough to only schedule jobs if they are not already scheduled (even across multiple instances of sidekiq).

### See database analytics

Boiler uses [pghero](https://github.com/ankane/pghero) for database analytics. To access the pghero interface, go to `/pghero` (e.g. `https://techmap.app/pghero`). You need to be an admin user to access this page.

# Useful things to know

### It's all SSL

Boiler's puma webserver is designed to be run with SSL (even locally). If you need to regenerate an SSL certificate for local development, you can do it like this: `openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout config/development-ssl/localhost.key -out config/development-ssl/localhost.crt`.

### Postgres for the database

Postgres is used for the database. You can connect to the database using the `psql` command-line tool. For example: `psql -d boiler_development`.

### Redis and Sidekiq for background jobs

Redis and Sidekiq are used for background jobs. Redis is used for job queuing, and Sidekiq is used to run jobs.

By default, Sidekiq runs on `localhost:6379` and Redis runs on `localhost:6379/12`.
